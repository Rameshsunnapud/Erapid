<p>
Interior Wall Protection's last material price increase was August 1, 2011. Since then we have worked diligently to control material<br>
and labor costs. We are now experiencing increased material, operating and freight costs.  While we were able to contain a price <br>
increase for a substantial amount of time, we are forced to increase book pricing for all product lines - profile, sheet, wall panels<br>
and wood profiles by 2.8% effective December 1. 2013. <BR>
As always, we will keep a sharp eye on competitive pricing and maintain our price levels accordingly.Sincerely,<br><BR>
The IWP Department

<tr>
	<td colspan='2'>
<p>
Did you know that the eRapid EJC configurator allows you to select the cutting charge for material that is supposed to be<br>
cut-to-size? The cutting charge is a 15% surcharge on each line of material that is being cut to specific sizes.<br>
This surcharge covers the material waste as well as the labor to cut it. It is often cheaper on smaller orders to quote<br>
standard lengths, even if the customer ends up with more material than they need. When this option is not selected,<br>
your pricing only includes material in standard lengths (usually 10’, sometimes 20’, with the obvious ZB/HB/Fire Barrier exceptions).<br>
If your customer requires materials to be cut to specific lengths (i.e. 8’-0", 5’-2", 13’-3", etc.), you must select the<br>
"Cut-To-Size" option. Many reps are quoting standard material, and then simply noting on the order that it should be cut<br>
to specific lengths. For example, one rep needed 7 pieces of FWF-200, 8’-0" long but only quoted 56’ of material without<br>
the cut-to-size charge. This should have been quoted as 70’ of material in standard lengths or 56’ with the cut-to-size charge.<br>
We’ve accommodated these past requests without objection because we have not clearly communicated the need to add the<br>
"Cut-To-Size" option. Beginning on 5/1/13, all quotes requiring non-standard lengths must have this added charge or we will need <br>
to discuss with you the options of covering this additional cost. Thank you for your cooperation.<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
The EJC Department

		<tr><td><p>The producer price index for construction materials increased 0.2% in August, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This series had shown steady upward movement during the first half of 2007, before settling back 0.4% in July.  Taken together, July and August provide some evidence that material prices are beginning to level off, although at a high level.  Since December 2006, the construction materials price index is up 2.4%.  On a year-over-year basis (August 2007 versus August 2006), the construction materials price index is up just 0.8%, more subdued than the 2% to 3% increases witnessed earlier in 2007, and down from the 9% to 10% increases reported in late summer 2006.

<p>
Please note the following upcoming eRapid enhancements, effective Monday, April 14th:<BR><BR>
1.  In the "Billing Customer" section of the Order Write-up Sheet (OWS), it will be mandatory to enter an email address for all orders.<BR>
This will enable CS to automatically email your customers their acknowledgements.  <BR>
As you are aware, many products are shipping with a very short lead time.  When hard copies of acknowledgements are mailed, often the customer already has their material before the acknowledgement is received.   <BR>
This initiative will ensure acknowledgements are emailed before the material is shipped.  <BR><BR>
2.  Submittal Section.  For ADS and EJC orders, a drafting email address is mandatory for all orders. <br>
For IWP and EFS, when submittals are by factory, the drafting email address will be mandatory. <br>
This will enable each SBU to email the customer submittals.  There will be the option to select "same email as bill to" or  <br>
"same email as invoice to" so you will not have to type in the same email address more than once should it be the same. <br>
If the customer would like hard copies of our submittals, just note such in the "Special Instructions" section and CS will be happy to fulfill their request.<br>

<tr>
	<td colspan='2'>
<p>
Did you know that the eRapid EJC configurator allows you to select the cutting charge for material that is supposed to be<br>
cut-to-size? The cutting charge is a 15% surcharge on each line of material that is being cut to specific sizes.<br>
This surcharge covers the material waste as well as the labor to cut it. It is often cheaper on smaller orders to quote<br>
standard lengths, even if the customer ends up with more material than they need. When this option is not selected,<br>
your pricing only includes material in standard lengths (usually 10’, sometimes 20’, with the obvious ZB/HB/Fire Barrier exceptions).<br>
If your customer requires materials to be cut to specific lengths (i.e. 8’-0", 5’-2", 13’-3", etc.), you must select the<br>
"Cut-To-Size" option. Many reps are quoting standard material, and then simply noting on the order that it should be cut<br>
to specific lengths. For example, one rep needed 7 pieces of FWF-200, 8’-0" long but only quoted 56’ of material without<br>
the cut-to-size charge. This should have been quoted as 70’ of material in standard lengths or 56’ with the cut-to-size charge.<br>
We’ve accommodated these past requests without objection because we have not clearly communicated the need to add the<br>
"Cut-To-Size" option. Beginning on 5/1/13, all quotes requiring non-standard lengths must have this added charge or we will need <br>
to discuss with you the options of covering this additional cost. Thank you for your cooperation.<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
The EJC Department

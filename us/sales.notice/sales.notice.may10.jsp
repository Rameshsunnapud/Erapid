			 <TR><TD><p>Interior Wall Protection's last price increase was September 1, 2008.  Since then we have worked diligently to control material and labor costs.
			   We are now experiencing increased metal costs, as well as all expenses related to oil and energy.  While we were able to contain a price increase for over 30 months, we are forced to increases prices for all product lines (profile, sheet, wall panels and wood profiles) by <u> 5% effective June 1, 2010</u>.  As always we will keep a sharp eye on competitive pricing, and maintain those price levels accordingly.

		<tr><td><p><br>The latest annualized quarter-over-quarter percent change in construction costs in the United States has been an alarming 18.5%, according to RSMeans July 2008 Construction Cost Index report.
		 The major reason has been a run-up in material costs due high prices in underlying commodities. For example, the international price of oil reached an all-time record level of $147.00 per barrel USD in mid-July. Many other commodity prices, while down somewhat from the highs at the peak of their cycles, remain elevated.

			<TR><TD><b>EFS Increase</b></TD></TR>
			 <TR><TD><p>
			   Despite increases in the cost of labor, materials, transportation (fuel) and changes in the supply chain, the EFS Department has held their selling prices at the 2008 price level.
				<br><br>We now need to increase selling prices in the range of 2% to 15% depending on the product. These increases will be seen in E-Rapid from <b><u>August 25, 2011</u></b>.
				 <br><br>As usual, we will honor existing quotes until their expiration date.
				<br><br>If you require more information please contact Sales Manager, <u>Lori Neitz</u>.

			<TR><TD><b>EJC Increase</b></TD></TR>
			 <TR><TD><p>
			   The EJC Team has not increased their sales prices for the last 3 years.  Material and running costs continue to increase.  We need to pass these increases along to the customer.
				<br><br>
				Effective <b><u>August 20, 2011</b></u>, we will implement price increases on quotes that meet the following criteria:
				<br><br><b>Direct Quotes* Under $10,000= 10% Increase</b><br>
				<b>Rep eRapid Quotes= 7% Increase</b>
				<br><br><i>*A "Direct Quote" is a quote prepared from a customer or rep's take-off (types and quantities).</i><br>

				<bR>We will honor existing quotes until their expiration date.
					All other quote types will not be affected by this price increase.
				<br><br>
					Contact National Sales Manager, <u>David Bailey</u> if you need additional information.

			<TR><TD><b>IWP Increase</b></TD></TR>
			 <TR><TD><p>
			   Over the past few months Interior Wall Protection has been hit with significant increases in metal costs, as well as expenses related to oil and energy. Because of these escalations we are forced to implement <i><b>a 5% price increase on all IWP product offerings.</b></i>
			   We realize that competition is tough and we will continue to keep a sharp eye on competitive pricing and maintain those price levels accordingly.
			   If you need competitive pricing, contact your RSSA.
			 </p>
			 <p>
			 Please be advised that these changes are effective <b><u>August 1st, 2011</b></u>. Pricing for quotes within the 90 day window will be honored. eRapid will automatically reflect these increases.

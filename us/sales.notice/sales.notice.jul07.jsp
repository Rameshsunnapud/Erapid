		<tr><td><p><b>US construction activity stops declining<br></b></p></td></tr>
		<tr><td><p>Within the US construction market, materials price increases have been restrained by the decline<i> (housing not our sector)</i> in total construction activity at a 5%-6% annual pace from the peak level early in 2006 to summer 2007. This coincides with the collapse of the housing market. The activity restraint on materials price inflation <b>is now ebbing, will turn neutral later this year and probably reverse by next summer, adding a small amount of upward pressure to materials price increases.</b> In turn, this coincides with the expected stabilization of housing starts this summer and the forecasted improving trend, albeit modest, by early next year.

The April increase was only 0.6% for the mix of materials used in the depressed housing market, but 1.6% in the booming non-residential building market and 2.4% for highway construction, which has been hit with large price increases for asphalt, concrete and steel.</p></td></tr>
